Net/Shared version 0.17
=======================

Net::Shared gives you the ability to share variables across processes that are either local or
remote.  No functions are exported by Net::Shared; the interface is Object Orientied.
Net::Shared::Local and Net::Shared::Remote objects are created and interfaced with a
Net::Shared::Handler object.  See the docs for more info.
